# IOT-based-water-flow-rate-and-measurement
In this project, we have built a water management system using water flow sensor &
NODEMCU. We have interfaced the water flow sensor with NODEMCU and LCD and
controlling the switching through self-made webpage and also connected to cloud via thing
speak IOT platform, and program it to display the volume of water, which has passed through
the valve. For this project, we have used the YF-S201 water flow sensor, which uses a hall
effect to sense the flow rate of the liquid.
This project utilizes the pulses of flow of water from sensor which is to measure the rate of
water flow for generating certain useful information like the amount of water usage, the bill.
accordingly, & the time of water availability locality wise and uploading those in personal
portals making it highly convenient.
